# Housing Market Analysis (Group 8)

This project looks at housing data from multiple sources and combines them into one dataset.  
Our goal was to explore relationships between home values, incomes, unemployment, school enrollment, and location.  

## Repo Structure
- `/outputs/` → charts and visuals generated from the data  
- `/docs/` → insights write-up (Housing_EDA_Insights.docx)  
- `/data/` → cleaned/merged datasets (if applicable)  
- `analysis_visuals.py` → script used for analysis + visualizations  

## Team Roles
- Data Cleaning Lead → Deborah  
- Merging Lead → Chasidy  
- Analysis Lead → Jonathan  
- Presentation Lead → Dina  

## Quick Insights
- Home values track closely with income (positive correlation).  
- Top ZIP codes and metros show very different market behaviors.  
- School enrollment tiers may signal property pricing trends.  
- Unemployment can act as a caution flag for investors.  

Outputs and insights are saved in the repo and ready to support the group presentation.
